# Purpose
Everyone needs a portfolio, one home for your favorites works of code. For my portfolio, I wanted a simple clean site that was both easy to navigate and appealing to the eye. With the nav-bar, a user could go directly to the specific section they are looking for. 

# My Experience
During this assignment, I enjoyed letting myself get creative and discovering different things I could do with my portfolio. I had some rounds of trial and error with css sizing settings.

# Credits
I thought the typewriter effect would give my portfolio some depth without over complicating the page. I used this css snippet by Geoff Graham to acheive the typewriter effect. I also linked the direct article below. <br>
